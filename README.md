Transform Any Room with AI-Powered Design Fusion - Real Photos + Inspiration Images = Stunning Visualizations


## Core Features Utilized

**Multi-Image Fusion**: Our application's foundation relies on Gemini's ability to seamlessly blend multiple images - combining real room photographs with inspiration images from various design sources. This creates cohesive design transformations that maintain the original room's architecture while incorporating desired aesthetic elements.

**Advanced Image Editing**: Gemini's natural language image editing capabilities enable users to transform spaces with simple text prompts like "add Scandinavian warmth with natural materials." The model maintains realistic lighting, proportions, and perspective while completely reimagining the room's appearance.

**Architectural Consistency**: The model's understanding of spatial relationships ensures transformed rooms retain structural integrity - windows, doors, and room dimensions remain consistent while furniture, colors, and decor are intelligently redesigned.

**Scene Understanding**: Gemini analyzes room layouts, lighting conditions, and existing elements to generate contextually appropriate designs. This prevents unrealistic transformations and ensures proper furniture placement and lighting integration.

**Visual Continuity**: When generating multiple design variations, the model maintains the same viewpoint and architectural features, enabling meaningful before/after comparisons essential for interior design decision-making.

These capabilities collectively enable InteriorAI Studio to bridge the gap between imagination and reality in interior design, making professional-quality room transformations accessible through simple image uploads and text descriptions.
